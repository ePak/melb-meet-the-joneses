This is a hacked responsive version of a static copy of thenewjoneses.com.

The major changes are replacing <table> with <div> and use masonry.js to "float" the elements around.
Due to the "floatness" of the elements, some of them have been reorderd to make them fit better layout-wise.

And the soundcloud widget has been removd as well.
